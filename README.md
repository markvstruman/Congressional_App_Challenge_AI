<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project was created in conjunction of having a Congressional App Challenge submission as well as a submission to the Science and Engineering fair of Metro Detroit (SEFMD). While this work was rather elementary in the classification model it applied for semantic analysis, this remains one of my proudest achievements -- marking the beginning of my interests in artificial intelligence/ML-models as well as statistics.

Despite earning an "Outstanding" classification upon its reviewal and judging, I pride the creativity that went into this project more than any accolade. This introduction to applying machine learning in an interdisciplinary work became the centerpiece of my continued education at the University of Michigan, College of Engineering. If my sixteen year old self who began coding this project knew how far this taste for applying computer science to other fields of passion would take him, I'm positive the excitement (and expected workload seeing my current work in the Life Science Institute's Ye Lab) would drive him mad with anticipation.
