BERLIN, June 10 (Reuters) - Switzerland has adopted new EU sanctions against
Belarus and Russia, also imposing financial and travel sanctions on 100
additional individuals and entities, including oligarch Aleksandra
Melnichenko, the Federal Council said on Friday.

The Swiss list of sanctioned individuals and entities, which is the same as
the European Union's, includes military personnel held responsible for
atrocities committed in Bucha, individuals active in the fields of politics
and disinformation and certain oligarchs and their family members, it said.

The council also approved the exclusion of four new Russian and Belarusian
banks, including Sberbank (SBER.MM), Russia's largest, from the SWIFT
transaction system was also approved.

The amendments come into force at 1600 GMT on Friday.
