scientific collaborations.

The number of scholars who declare affiliations in both China and the United
States on research papers has dropped by more than 20% over the past 3 years,
an analysis conducted for _Nature_ has found. That slump seems to be part of a
pattern of waning US–China collaboration that is starting to show up in
research databases. The number of papers that were collaborations between
authors in the United States and China — the world’s two largest research
producers — also fell for the first time last year.

These signs of falling collaboration are at least in part a result of the
COVID-19 pandemic, scholars say, but also of political tensions. These include
the effects of the United States’ controversial China Initiative, a policy
supposed to prevent espionage that targeted many US academics for not
disclosing some of their work or funding in China. “We’re starting to see the
damaging consequence that results from a combination of restricted mobility
and heightened politicization,” says Joy Zhang, a sociologist at the
University of Kent in Canterbury, UK. “Having dual affiliation was once seen
as a badge of honour, but is now tinted by the concern of scientific
espionage,” she says.

The US government seems to be dropping its decades-long support for scientific
collaboration with China just as some of China’s research is at a world-class
level, says Deborah Seligsohn, a political scientist at Villanova University
in Pennsylvania. “If the United States stops collaborating with China, we’re
cutting off our access to a huge part of what’s going on in the scientific
world,” she says.

## Dual-affiliation decline

The analysis of dual affiliations was conducted for _Nature_ by Jeroen Baas,
director of analytics at the Amsterdam-based publisher Elsevier. Baas looked
at the authors of millions of papers in Elsevier’s Scopus database, and found
that the number of authors who reported a dual US–China affiliation on at
least one publication in a year had risen to more than 15,000 by 2018, but had
dropped to below 12,500 by 2021 (see ‘Dual affiliations’). This fall was more
sustained than for other pairs of nations, Baas found, and it occurred even as
the global number of authors disclosing multiple affiliations continued to
rise.

articles).

The pattern might help to explain how publications with co-authors from China
and the United States also fell in 2021, the Scopus figures show, even as
total US and Chinese outputs are both increasing. Baas’s analysis suggests
that there has been a much sharper fall among the subset of these publications
that have dual-affiliated authors (see ‘US–China collaboration’).

2021. Dual affiliated authors had the biggest
fall.](//media.nature.com/lw800/magazine-

In February, Caroline Wagner at the Ohio State University in Columbus and
Xiaojing Cai at Yangzhou University in China used data from the Web of Science
to show that US–China co-authored papers were falling as a share of world
publications, whereas papers with co-authors from China and the European Union
were not. They also published a table suggesting that the number of papers
with dual-affiliated US–China authors has had a sharper fall1.

## Pandemic and politics

Zhang and five other specialists contacted by _Nature_ said that greater
politicization of US–Chinese science, as well as the pandemic, was playing a
part. As early as 2015–16, Zhang says, it became harder for foreign academics
to get visas approved to visit China, and for Chinese researchers to travel
overseas. And from 2018, the US government’s China Initiative started to
investigate hundreds of US-based scientists over their collaborations in
China. Researchers say that together with more onerous US visa restrictions
and tightened export controls, this programme has dampened bilateral US–China
research partnerships and dissuaded scientists in China from visiting the
United States. The initiative was effectively terminated this year, but China
is included in a broader US Department of Justice ‘strategy for countering
nation-state threats’.

In 2021, a survey of nearly 2,000 scientists in the United States found that
about half of respondents of Chinese descent experienced fear or anxiety that
they were being surveilled by the US government, and were more likely than
non-Chinese scientists to say they had stopped collaborations with researchers
in China over the past 3 years. “My overall concern on the US side is the
extent to which collaboration with China is being criminalized, even post-
China Initiative,” says Jenny Lee, a social scientist at the University of
Arizona in Tucson, who was one of the co-authors of the survey.

She and John Haupt, also at the University of Tucson, have been interviewing
US-based and China-based scientists to study how they collaborated on COVID-19
research. Their work, not yet published, shows that pandemic-related travel
and visa restrictions prevented many Chinese scientists from visiting the
United States — and the researchers also reported political restrictions.
“Some scientists have been asked by their institutions to cut ties with
Chinese scientists and no longer hire postdocs from China,” Haupt says.

## Academic courtesy

Dual affiliations needn’t always signify dual employment or funding, says Li
Tang, a science- and innovation-policy researcher at Fudan University in
Shanghai, China, who last year published a paper about the negative effects of
chilled bilateral US–China relations spreading into education and research2.
They might be reported as a courtesy by an academic to an institution they
visited that gave them research assistance, or at the visited institution’s
request, she notes.

Data gleaned from research papers are also a lagging indicator of actual
activity, because publications might not appear until years after a study was
done. And the specific reasons for the collaboration and dual-affiliation
decline might vary between disciplines and institutions, notes Zhang. Still,
she says it’s reasonable to suspect that deteriorating political relations,
including the China Initiative, have led to researchers and universities in
both countries hesitating to initiate and strengthen collaborations.

China’s national policies might also be affecting publication data, Lee adds:
in 2020, for instance, the government said that there should be less focus on
evaluating researchers by the volume of their work in international-journal
databases, and more on the quality of their papers. They were also urged to
consider publishing in Chinese journals. That might now be starting to feed
through into data indexed in Scopus or Web of Science, which focus on English-
language journals. Tang says it will be important to watch whether the falling
collaboration patterns continue in the future.

“Sadly, this all seems to be political in nature on both sides,” adds Wagner.
“Science will suffer.”
