##  **Picks of the week**

 **Welcome to the Neighbourhood  
BBC Sounds, episodes weekly from Wednesday 29 Jun**  
If community messageboards and apps intrigue you, Jayde Adams gets it. Here
she invites guests to join her and revel in the unintentional hilarity of
online spaces where people will try to swap the Bounty bars out of their
Celebrations for better chocolates. Bin day and arguments over high streets
feature heavily, with Adams hitting the nail on the “only-saying-what-
everyone’s-thinking” head in every discussion.

 **The Seduction  
Widely available, episodes weekly**  
A twisted true-crime love story is always an ear magnet, and that’s
particularly the case with this lusty, obsessive age-gap affair between Patty
Presba and Jaime Ramos. Keith Morrison’s deliberately hammed-up narration is
perfect for this film noir-style drama about “a kid and a dame” plus a
murdered husband. _HV_

 **Sound Barrier: Sylvester  
Spotify, episodes weekly**  
As the crafter of disco’s finest tune, You Make Me Feel (Mighty Real),
Sylvester was ahead of his time both musically and in terms of being an openly
gay Black man. This brilliant podcast, the first in a series, is unflinching
in showing his ruthless ambition, with beautiful demos and comments from
superfans including Patti LaBelle and Billy Porter. _HV_

 **Hollywood& Crime: The Execution of Bonny Lee Bakley  
Wondery, episodes weekly**  
If scandal had a voice, Tracy Pattin would own it, and now she’s joined by
actor Josh Lucas to pull at the threads of a twisty murder case. When Bonny
Lee Bakley was found dead in her car with a gunshot wound, her husband, Robert
Blake, was the prime suspect, but – to further add fuel to the true-crime fire
– she also had a lot of enemies. _HV_

 **Romance Road Test**  
 **Audible, episodes weekly**  
Hosts Kristen Meinzer and Jolenta Greenberg are open about the state of their
“not so sexy” marriages as they try to rekindle passion when life, illness and
the seven-year itch gets in the way. The first job is to recreate their first
dates including frozen pizza, Muay Thai videos and kissing noises.
Heartwarming stuff. _HV_

##  **There’s a podcast for that**

This week, Rachel Aroesti chooses five of the best **podcasts to make you
smarter** , from a famous QI spin-off to Claudia Winkleman’s therapy-like
series on emotional intelligence

 **No Such Thing As A Fish  
** Once upon a time (the mid-to-late 00s), QI had a secure footing in the
comedy zeitgeist. With Stephen Fry long gone and desk-based panel shows having
fallen from favour, that time is well and truly over. Yet the programme’s team
of uber-clever researchers have managed to stay at the forefront of pop
culture with their wildly popular podcast. Each episode sees the endearingly
swotty QI Elves swap little known facts (the pod’s title being a particularly
fascinating example). Its scattershot randomness – combined with the hosts’
giddy banter – makes for a show whose interestingness levels never dip below
very.

 **In Our Time  
** The original cerebral radio programme is, of course, a podcast these days
too. In fact, it has been since 2004 – and in 2011, the entire archive of
Melvyn Bragg’s Radio 4 show became available in podcast form (such is the
wealth of material, certain pod distributors have handily divided episodes
into the genres of religion, science, history, philosophy and culture). If its
subject matter can often seem intimidatingly intellectual (recent episodes
have covered French playwright Olympe de Gouges and Plato’s Gorgias), it’s
worth sticking with: this is as rigorous and detailed as explainers aimed at
the general public get.

 **How Did We Get Here?  
** Intelligence isn’t just about reeling off reams of esoteric facts or pi to
a thousand decimal places: emotional wisdom is just as important. This show,
presented by Claudia Winkleman and her clinical psychologist best friend Tanya
Byron, provides a masterclass in unpicking human behaviour, helping the
listener get a firmer grasp on why people behave like they do. Each episode is
structured around a real-life therapy session – Winkleman empathically
comforts the patient, Byron uses her professional nous to dig into their
predicament – covering topics including challenging children, suicide, absent
parents and, invariably, other issues that linger just below the surface.

 **The Allusionist  
** There are a lot of words for things nowadays, aren’t there? That’s partly
because the confluence of the internet and identity politics is making
language a far more precise and sensitive tool. In contrast to the “you-
can’t-say-anything-any more” brigade, this show from podcast veteran Helen
Zaltzman – sister of Andy – explains and examines our ever-evolving vocabulary
in a celebratory and interested way. Examples include inclusive terminology
for trans parents, asexuality and aromanticism, and misogynoir, while other
episodes look at more established linguistic themes: the art of apologies,
sleuthing slang and the concept of zero. Eclectic, certainly, but extremely
edifying too.

 **Talking Politics  
** Made in partnership with the London Review of Books, Talking Politics began
life in 2016, partly as a way to make sense of the Brexit vote. Things, it is
safe to say, did not get any less complicated thereafter, which means there
have been plenty of developments for host David Runciman and his fellow
Cambridge academics to chew over in exactingly learned style since then. If
keeping up with politics seems a sisyphean task in 2022, it might come as a
relief to know that the podcast actually concluded for good in March – so
there’s at least some hope of getting up to speed on the past six years.

##  **Why not try …**

  * An audacious scam story with a hint of Robin Hood in Persona: The French Deception.  

  * More chatty fun and foodie anecdotes to make your stomach rumble in the new series of My Favourite Takeaway.

  * From strays to canine heroes, more doggy facts than you can shake a stick-shaped chew toy at in Off Leash.
