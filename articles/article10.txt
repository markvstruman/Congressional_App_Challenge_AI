He added, “The Fed should be as apolitical as possible, and its policy focus should be on stabilizing both inflation and output fluctuations, as is mandated by congressional legislation.”

But it’s hard to divorce the Fed from its historical roots, founded as it was in an era of great political turmoil driven by frequent financial panics.

The Fed was successfully established in 1913 because President Woodrow Wilson won the assent of William Jennings Bryan, the most influential populist leader of the time, by guaranteeing that government officials appointed by the president, not private sector bankers, would run the board.

At Bryan’s insistence, the Fed was also decentralized into 12 regional “reserve banks” to dilute the influence of New York financiers and promote lending to farmers across the country.

“It’s certainly embedded in the original idea of the Federal Reserve that it be broadly responsive to the needs of the citizenry,” said Eric Rauchway, a professor of history at the University of California, Davis and the author of “Why the New Deal Matters.”

Inflation F.A.Q. Card 1 of 5 What is inflation? Inflation is a loss of purchasing power over time, meaning your dollar will not go as far tomorrow as it did today. It is typically expressed as the annual change in prices for everyday goods and services such as food, furniture, apparel, transportation and toys. What causes inflation? It can be the result of rising consumer demand. But inflation can also rise and fall based on developments that have little to do with economic conditions, such as limited oil production and supply chain problems. Is inflation bad? It depends on the circumstances. Fast price increases spell trouble, but moderate price gains can lead to higher wages and job growth. How does inflation affect the poor? Inflation can be especially hard to shoulder for poor households because they spend a bigger chunk of their budgets on necessities like food, housing and gas. Can inflation affect the stock market? Rapid inflation typically spells trouble for stocks. Financial assets in general have historically fared badly during inflation booms, while tangible assets like houses have held their value better.









The Fed came of age between the two world wars — a period dominated by the determination of political and economic leaders on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean to halt the rise of communism on the left and fascism on the right. And though the central bank bears a great deal of responsibility for the stock market crash of 1929 and the ensuing Great Depression, monetary policy was an inextricable part of that effort.
