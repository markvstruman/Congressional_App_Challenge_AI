THE LAST WORD

"During the 2020 election, Twitter [working with the US government] did this with the help of the FBI, committing censorship on behalf of one candidate while working to hurt the other candidate. It is hard to imagine a more brazen attack on our democracy than this. This is not how our system is supposed to work. In fact, it's illegal."

- TUCKER CARLSON
