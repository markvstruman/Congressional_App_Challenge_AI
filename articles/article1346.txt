With each Twitter File drop we learn just how scared the old leftist guard of Twitter was of free thought, free speech, and TRUTH!

I’m Tomi Lahren, more next.

With each Twitter files drop we are learning more and more about the GREAT lengths old Twitter went to stifle conservative speech.

Yet, didn’t former CEO Jack Dorsey testify BEFORE CONGRESS the censoring, shadow banning and selective filtering of conservatives and our content WAS NOT happening?!

And what about the mainstream media, who has held, even to this DAY, that conservative censorship is just a big conspiracy theory..will they apologize..heck even ACKNOWLEDGE the truth?!

Look, we did not need Elon Musk or Bari Weiss or Matt Taibbi to tell us we’ve been screwed over on social media, any conservative with a following and tenacity for spreading the truth KNOWS this has been happening and happening for years. But these files, this all-out EXPOSURE should serve as a reckoning on big tech, as a whole.

If Twitter was doing this, then we know Facebook, Instagram, Google and other search engines were, and still are!

When will Congress finally get serious about prosecuting and holding accountable those big tech CEOs who have been lying and covering this up- unchecked- for years?!

It’s time to start digging even deeper!
