Paula Uhing, a steelworker from Germantown, Wisconsin, found herself as a single mother of a 13-year-old daughter when the union helped keep her afloat.

“I’m supporting Mandela Barnes for Senate because I feel very strongly about the union,” Uhing said of the Democratic candidate. “Those were the wages that helped me through, that helped me through everything — the layoffs and shutdowns. It was those wages and my seniority that I held onto my job. And I was able to return in the same position I left.”

Uhing, 52, also said she wanted safeguards around women's rights, including reproductive rights, as well same-sex partnerships.

Christopher Harris, a steelworker who was born and raised in Milwaukee, said Barnes understood the life of working people – and in particular the importance of preserving Social Security.

“I don’t want nobody touching my Social Security. Worked all my life for it and I need that,” said Harris, 60, who is also political chair for the United Steelworkers Local 7-209.

Kwami Barnes, 47, a communications worker, also cited the Democrat's understanding of working people's lives. "His feet are planted on the ground perfectly,” he said.

“And if we don’t have working-class people fighting for jobs, fighting for fairness, fighting for decent wages, dignity, then we don’t have a democracy,” added Barnes, who is no relation to the candidate.

The Democratic lieutenant governor is challenging Republican Sen. Ron Johnson in one of the most competitive races on the midterm map.
