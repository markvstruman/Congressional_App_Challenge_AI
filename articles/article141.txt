Former President Barack Obama rebuked the election-denying GOP Nevada secretary of state nominee as he campaigned for Democrats on Tuesday ahead of next week’s midterms.

At a rally in Las Vegas, Obama mocked Republican Jim Marchant for staunchly defending Donald Trump’s lies about the 2020 election with a scathing football analogy.

Obama pointed out how Marchant, a former state representative locked in a tight race with Democrat Cisco Aguilar, has tried to ”one-up all Republicans peddling lies about the 2020 election” by claiming that all elections in Nevada have been “fake” for the last 15 years.

Marchant was “not someone you want” overseeing an election, said Obama.

He continued: “It’d be like if the Raiders played the Chiefs and you noticed that instead of the refs who’ve been calling games for 20 years, somebody said, ‘Hey, how about that guy over there wearing the Chiefs gear who’s been tailgating for the last three hours, drinking some brews and ranting about how the Chiefs actually beat the Bucks in the Super Bowl last year, they look impartial, let’s put them in charge.’”

“If you wouldn’t do that for a football game, why would you do it for an election?” Obama added.
