Eric Trump stated this week that he leads a “clean, positive life” by waking up at 4:30 a.m. every single day to say the Pledge of Allegiance to his two young children, ages 5 and 3.

“And then I say the Lord’s Prayer, and I say two other little family prayers that we have. Then I make them say something that’s meaningful to them,” the second-born son of former President Donald Trump said in a video interview with Julie Green, a self-styled prophet who has claimed that President Joe Biden is secretly dead.

“I do this every single night at 7:45 no matter where I am in the world,” the Trump scion confusingly continued. “If I can’t be there, I’m doing it on FaceTime.”

This isn’t the first time that Eric Trump’s family has offered a peek into what goes on at home. In September, wife Lara Trump drew backlash for sharing a video of their visibly upset son out in heavy rain during Hurricane Ian, which she described at the time as “character building.”

People on Twitter had thoughts about Eric Trump’s new claim.

“This is the MOST never happened thing ever,” cracked one critic.
