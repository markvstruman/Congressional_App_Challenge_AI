US stocks were whipsawed Wednesday. The market was solidly higher before the Federal Reserve announced an expected interest rate hike of half a percentage point.

But stocks gave up all their gains as investors focused on new forecasts from the Fed that showed slower economic growth and higher unemployment and inflation rates for 2023 than what the Fed predicted in September. The central bank also lifted its projections for how high interest rates may need to go before the end of next year.

The Dow fell more than 140 points, or 0.4%.

The S&P 500 lost 0.6%.

The Nasdaq Composite was down 0.8%.

As stocks settle after the trading day, levels might still change slightly.
