Fox News contributor Katie Pavlich joins Fox Across America With Jimmy Failla to shed light on how recent information uncovered in the Twitter Files should undermine our trust in the FBI and certain other government institutions.

“When you talk about a democracy, as the Left and Democrats often do, if these institutions can’t be trusted to be fair and evenhanded and nonpolitical, then nobody trusts the results. And we then go through a cycle after cycle of not trusting the result for legitimate reasons, considering how much we know now about what the FBI was doing, who was working at the FBI, James Baker, of course, who was at the FBI during the dossier saga and push the ridiculous Russia collusion hoax on Donald Trump for the entire span of his presidency. Then going over to Twitter and working with the FBI to use a private company to subvert and go around constitutional rights that Americans have in this country. That brings up big questions about results of how the structure of power works and it’s not a good thing today, and it certainly is not something that is sustainable long term as people continue to distrust the very institutions that they’re supposed to really be able to, trust with protecting them from terrorism, for example. And unfortunately, when they do these things, there are calls to defund the FBI, to eliminate it. And that includes all the good things that they do. So it is a huge problem.”
