Ohio Republican Congressman Jim Jordan joins Fox Across America With Jimmy Failla to give his take on the House January 6th Select committee voting to send criminal referrals to the Justice Department recommending former President Trump be criminally prosecuted.

“This is the first time in American history where you have a committee where there’s no cross-examination ability because all nine members had voted to impeach President Trump. The Minority Leader for the first time in history, wasn’t allowed to appoint to this select committee the people he or she had selected. Never happened before. And then add on top of all that, the lies they told that we caught them in, even though we were part of the committee, even though it could be in the depositions, couldn’t see the transcripts, we still caught them in numerous lies and two in particular about me. So, yeah, this is what this committee was up to.”

Plus, Rep. Jordan and Jimmy talk about some of the recent revelations in the Twitter Files. To hear what else he had to say, listen to the podcast!
