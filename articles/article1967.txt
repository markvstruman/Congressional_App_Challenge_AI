The January 6th committee has recommended the DOJ investigate Donald Trump.

Wow, how original. I’m Tomi Lahren, more next.

It’s like Christmas, Hanukkah and New Years wrapped into one for the perpetually Trump-deranged- The January 6th panel wants the DOJ to investigate Trump over his involvement in January 6th.

For the rest of us, this is Groundhog’s Day. Investigating Donald Trump, huh? What else is new?

The panel, in all its overhyped glory, says Trump obstructed an official proceeding, conspired to defraud the US, made a false statement and their favorite- incited an insurrection.

Look, January 6th was a bad day for America but can these selective pearl-clutches STOP with their faux outrage almost two years later?

If you think January 6th was bad, I hope y’all will take a look at the summer justice riot season of 2020!

And if you want to do a meaningful investigation, let’s hear how Hunter Biden and the “big guy” situation is finally gonna see the light of justice and day!

This is all such a waste of time. Get a new hobby!
