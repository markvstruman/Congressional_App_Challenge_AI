“German business is entering the holiday season with a sense of hope,” Ifo said in a statement. The December improvement in overall sentiment was the third in a row, but it marked the first time that businesses have been more positive about their current situation after six months of increasing pessimism.

It has taken measures including reactivating old oil- and coal-fired power stations, extending the life of the country’s last nuclear power plants by a few months, and building liquefied natural gas terminals — the first of which was inaugurated on Saturday.
