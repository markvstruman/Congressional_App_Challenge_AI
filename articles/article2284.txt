CIA director Bill Burns said Friday he believes Russia's attacks against Ukraine's infrastructure will continue, although the agency does anticipate a "reduced tempo" of fighting through the winter.

For now, the CIA does not see an immediate path to negotiations to end the conflict, he said.

“It's not our assessment that the Russians are serious at this point about a real negotiation,” Burns told PBS’s Judy Woodruff in an interview.

Putin's punishing attacks: Since October, Russia has launched a series of strikes that have damaged the energy system and civilian infrastructure, causing power outages in the freezing winter. On Friday, missile attacks were reported across Ukraine, including in Kyiv, Odesa, Kharkiv and Zaporizhzhia.
