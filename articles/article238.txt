President Biden made a surprise phone call to Republican Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine on Wednesday, congratulating him on his re-election, Bloomberg reported.

Biden has called a slew of Democrats who won their midterm races since Tuesday evening, but his call with DeWine may be the first he made to a Republican. DeWine cruised to victory over Democratic challenger Nan Whaley with nearly 63% of the vote.

The call is particularly surprising given former President Donald Trump's endorsement of DeWine.

DeWine is one of several Republican governors who successfully fended off Democratic challengers on Tuesday.
