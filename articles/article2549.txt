At the final January 6th House committee hearing on Monday, lawmakers on the panel voted to refer criminal charges to the Department of Justice for former President Trump. Referrals from Congress serve only as recommendations and do not compel any concrete action from the DOJ. Former DOJ attorney Richard Serafini joins the Rundown to discuss the Department of Justiceâ€™s role following this referral and why it is unlikely that any of the evidence presented by the House committee will be useful to the Department of Justice. He explains the greater likelihood of Congress passing legislation on electoral laws, his belief that criminal charges are unlikely to hold up, and why it will be voters who decide whether or not former President Trump becomes president again.

The new Congress will be sworn in two weeks from today, yet House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy is still facing an uphill battle securing the votes needed for him to become the next Speaker of the House. As it currently stands, five Republican members of Congress oppose his Speakership and without a Speaker in charge, Congress would find itself immobilized. FOX News Senior Congressional Correspondent Chad Pergram joins the Rundown to discuss why Representative McCarthy is facing opposition, what problems this could pose for the newest Congress, and the legislation waiting to be passed within the lame-duck congressional session.
