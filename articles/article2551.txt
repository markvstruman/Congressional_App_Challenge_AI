Texas Republican Congressman-elect Wesley Hunt joins Fox Across America With Jimmy Failla to explain why he believes GOP Senators should stand up and vote against the $1.7 trillion omnibus spending bill.

“Me and 15 of my other colleagues have already sent a letter to leadership urging them to not pass this omnibus bill. And the reason why is this. We want to be able to go into the next Congress with a clean slate. Let’s start from scratch. We’re going to have the majority. We’re going to be able to get some things through that directly benefit the American people, like making sure we have border security, like making sure we actually reduce our place in this country, like unleashing American energy and stopping the assault on our energy and oil and gas industry in our own country. I want to be able to start from a clean slate to do that. We are 12 days away from taking over the majority. So we are urging our leadership to not pass this so that we on our terms can dictate how we spend America’s money.”

Plus, Congressman-elect Hunt talks about a bill he’s advocating for which would allow star Army football player Andre Carter to begin his pro career in 2023. Listen to the podcast to hear what else he had to say!
