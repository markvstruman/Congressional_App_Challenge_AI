"I’m hoping that when we vote again there’s a huge difference in those numbers," Nia, from Atlanta, told Fox News. "Herschel Walker just kind of scares me."

"I really don’t want him to be in any position where he can make big decisions," Nia said.

Gov. Brian Kemp for a second time defeated his Democratic challenger, Stacey Abrams, in the Georgia gubernatorial election Tuesday. Georgia has historically leaned Republican, though in 2021, Warnock and Sen. Jon Ossoff became the first Democrats elected to Senate since 2005.
