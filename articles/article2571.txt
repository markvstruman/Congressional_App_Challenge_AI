Florida Republican Congresswoman Kat Cammack joins Fox Across America With Jimmy Failla to talk about why she is emphatically against the over 4,000-page, $1.7 trillion omnibus spending bill Democrats are hoping to get passed before the end of the year.

“If you can’t read the bill, you shouldn’t be voting on it. Right? And that’s why we’re pushing for 72 hours at least to be able to read the bill. But then you look at all the craziness that’s in here. Nancy Pelosi, in her last hurrah, wants to stick it to us and say, even though I lost the gavel, I’m going to still dictate to you Republicans what you’re going to do and how you’re going to do it. And I’ll be damned if we let her do it. So every Republican, I don’t care how conservative or how moderate you are, you need to be voting no. And for all the retiring members, you got nothing left to lose except your country. So you might as well vote no and do the last good thing that you can while you’re in office. And I encourage everybody listening, call your members of Congress. They’ll be in Washington tomorrow. Blow their phone lines up. That is what we can do to help save Christmas from the Grinch, a.k.a Biden.”

Rep. Cammack also criticizes the White House for their hypocrisy when it comes to Title 42 and the health of people in this country. Listen to the podcast to hear what else she had to say!
