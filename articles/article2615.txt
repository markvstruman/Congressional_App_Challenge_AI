BREAKING NEWS: Leftist journalists only care about censorship when they THINK it’s happening to them!

What a shocker! I’m Tomi Lahren, more next.

New Twitter head honcho Elon Musk is taking a lot of heat for suspending and then quickly reinstating several high-profile journalists from his platform.

He had a reason, though. These writers from the NY Times, Washington Post, CNN and others were involved in sharing his real-time location- something he says will not fly on the platform.

And I agree! You don’t get to endanger someone’s real life safety under the guise of free speech. That’s where we should ALL draw the line. Doxxing and location sharing NEEDS to be OFF LIMITS!

But even though Elon reinstated these accounts, the liberal media is still going bananas he DARED to punish them in the first place.

WOW! It took the 7-day suspension of these liberal journalists from these liberal outlets to get these liberal journalists and their liberal outlets to cover censorship in any way, shape, or form?!

It goes to show what we’ve known all along, it’s gonna take a taste of their own medicine to get them to give one iota of a crap about the things we’ve been battling for a decade or more.
