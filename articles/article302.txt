Seven words that Mike Pence said about declining to appear before the House committee investigating the U.S. Capitol riot should prohibit the former vice president from ever holding public office again, a former federal prosecutor has argued.

In a YouTube video released Thursday, Glenn Kirschner issued a damning critique of Pence’s recent claim that “Congress has no right to my testimony” about the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection.

Kirschner, who was a prosecutor in the U.S. attorney’s office in Washington for more than two decades, said Congress has a legitimate purpose in investigating Donald Trump’s attempted overthrow of the 2020 election result, which indicated that rival Joe Biden would be taking his place in the White House.

Pence ultimately did not go along with the insurrectionist effort, despite pressure from Trump and his supporters — many of whom chanted, “Hang Mike Pence” on the day of the violence.

Pence, a potential 2024 GOP candidate, has “some of the most directly relevant evidence [as] to what happened,” Kirschner continued.

“Let’s be clear: By extension, Mike Pence is saying, ‘The American people have no right to my relevant testimony as Congress goes about trying to craft laws to keep this from ever happening again,’” Kirshner said.
