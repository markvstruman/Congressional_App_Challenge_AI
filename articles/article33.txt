Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has shown himself uniquely skilled at attracting attention beyond the borders of his home state. Just this month, DeSantis blocked state funds for the Tampa Bay Rays’ stadium after players voiced support for gun control in the wake of the mass shooting in Uvalde, Texas. He’s also continuing a fight to punish the Disney corporation for criticizing Florida’s so-called “Don’t Say Gay” law. An Ivy League-educated anti-élitist firebrand, he is willing to pick a fight with anyone—reporters, health officials, teachers, Mickey Mouse—to grab a headline. DeSantis “practically radiates ambition,” the staff writer Dexter Filkins tells David Remnick, in a conversation that has been edited for length and clarity. “He sounds like Trump, except that he speaks in complete sentences. . . . He’s very good at staking out a position and pounding the table and saying, I’m not giving in to the liberals in the Northeast.” Yet, despite having been anointed by Donald Trump in his primary election, DeSantis has refused to “kiss the ring,” and many see DeSantis as a possible opponent to Trump in a 2024 Republican primary.

Remnick: Dexter, right now we’re watching the January 6th hearings, and at the same time Ron DeSantis, the governor of Florida, is making a lot of noise as a politician. Is it very likely that he’s the No. 1 contender behind Trump to inherit the mantle of the Republican Party?

Filkins: Yes, I think so. All the polls suggest that, if Trump doesn’t run, DeSantis is in pole position and he’s ready. He’s got more than a hundred million dollars in the bank. He practically radiates ambition.

Remnick: Let’s talk a little bit about his background. Who is Ron DeSantis? Where does he come from? What kind of person is he?

Filkins: He’s from Florida. He was born in Jacksonville; he grew up outside of Tampa, in a town called Dunedin, and it’s a working-class neighborhood. Working-class guy, went to public school. He was a great baseball player in Little League, where they won the World Series, and in high school. He went to Yale on a baseball scholarship and then on to Harvard Law School. So he’s come a long way.

Remnick: Did he distinguish himself academically at Yale and then Harvard Law?

Filkins: He did. In fact, one of the more funny quotes that I got from one of his former classmates at Yale was that Ron was so smart that we couldn’t plagiarize off of his papers because everyone would know where it came from, because he’s the only one that smart who could have made that argument.

Remnick: He’s smart in what way?

Filkins: More than a couple of people told me his memory is practically photographic. Particularly, when I was having conversations about the coronavirus, he was reading medical journals, and he’d read them once. He would digest it, he would understand it and could have a conversation about it. He’s very, very fast.

Remnick: How would you describe Ron DeSantis ideologically, and how did he become that way?

Filkins: It’s hard to tell how much of Ron DeSantis is ideological and how much is opportunism. He sounds like Trump, except that he speaks in complete sentences. He’s very, very articulate and very, very quick, but he’s competing for the same constituencies. He’s very, very angry at the élites, even though he went to Harvard and Yale. He’s very angry at Washington. He’s very angry at the politicians. He’s rallying basically the white working class of Florida, of which the numbers are still quite large. He’s angry.

Remnick: How did he become governor? My understanding is that although he’s now seen as the dominant political figure in state politics—obviously Trump himself is in Palm Beach—that DeSantis really kind of squeaked by to get in.

Filkins: He squeaked by. He did. I think he won by less than one per cent. I think there was at least one automatic recount. He defeated a politician named Andrew Gillum, who had been the mayor of Tallahassee. Very, very close race. I think he benefitted from the fact that Gillum—not only was he Black in a state within the former Confederacy but also because Gillum came from the left of the Party. Gillum had squeaked in and had beaten a moderate to get the nomination, against Gwen Graham, who many people believed would’ve fared much better against DeSantis. DeSantis won just by a hair, but he’s been a missile going straight up ever since.

Remnick: What do you mean?

Filkins: He has developed a style, which is very visible, very theatrical, again very angry, but it has made him a national politician. Over the last couple of years, he really built himself and his persona—I hate to use the word “brand,” but it’s a brand—around the way that he dealt with the coronavirus. Essentially, it played in perfectly for him and his style because he could say, “I don’t agree with Fauci and all the pinheads in Washington. All they want to do is oppress you and make you wear masks and keep your children at home.” He charted this very, very novel course on the coronavirus. That’s what made him famous.

Remnick: Now, the COVID policy that you describe is not just sheer obstinate ignorance—we’ve seen some of that in political quarters in the last few years—but something a little bit more complicated.

Filkins: I had a long conversation with a professor at Stanford, of public health, an epidemiologist named Jay Bhattacharya, who said he was sitting at home one day on a Sunday and his phone rang and it was Ron DeSantis. He wanted to talk about the coronavirus. Bhattacharya, very much like DeSantis, was charting a slightly different course. Basically—I’m going to make this a little crude, but it’s essentially—masking doesn’t really work. The only thing you can really do is protect the elderly, which DeSantis did from the get-go. Protect the elderly, and basically try to ride the virus out until a vaccine comes, but don’t kid yourself. There’s not that much that we can do about it. What followed from that, naturally, was: keep the schools open, keep the government offices open, keep the beaches open, keep the shopping malls open. That’s what Florida did. Very, very different from, say, New York or California.

Remnick: And how are its statistics?

Filkins: That’s very, very interesting. They went up and down and up and down, and he caught a lot of hell over the course of the pandemic. But today, in 2022, the numbers aren’t bad. Florida is in the middle when you look at death rates. It’s pretty much in the middle of the pack, right next to California. California shut down their entire economy, all their schools, for two years. Florida kept everything open. So, he’s looking better than he did.

Remnick: Now, another issue that’s been crucial to his presence on the national scene is L.G.B.T.Q. issues and how they’re taught in schools. DeSantis has been out front on that. He passed a law a couple of months ago, called the Parental Rights in Education or the so-called Don’t Say Gay law, where he supported it. What’s the deal there? Tell me what happened and what role DeSantis plays there.
