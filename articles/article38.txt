Yes, it’s just one survey. Polling averages are more reliable. But those numbers are comparable, I’m told, to the Shapiro campaign’s internal polling.

Shapiro’s team fully expects a close race, but there’s an important dynamic here to watch. Should the race remain close, national Republican groups have signaled, they intend to spend money on Mastriano’s behalf. That could eat into Shapiro’s overwhelming financial advantage and allow Republicans to project a more mainstream image of their candidate than he presents himself.

Mastriano has taken some extreme positions. He favors a ban on abortion with no exceptions for rape or incest, and has openly embraced the QAnon conspiracy theory. And he has been a leading figure in Donald Trump’s drive to overturn the results of the 2020 election — proudly promoting his presence at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. The House panel investigating the Jan. 6 riot has subpoenaed him.

On Monday, Mastriano named Jenna Ellis, a former lawyer for the Trump campaign who was intimately involved in the effort to toss out Joe Biden’s victory, as a senior legal adviser.

Then on Tuesday, NBC News reported that Mastriano had told an interviewer that he saw “parallels” between the federal government’s prosecution of suspects in the Jan. 6 riot and the Nazis’ use of the 1933 Reichstag fire to crack down on dissent and seize unrestricted power in Germany.

Hitler analogies are rarely a good idea in American politics, and that particular comparison is not one that historians are likely to find credible. But with many voters experiencing serious economic distress, Mastriano’s poll numbers ought to be sobering for Democrats all over the country.
