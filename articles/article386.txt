“Our mother’s zest and passion for life, her children, grandchildren and her many animals, not to mention her eternal joy of creating, were unparalleled and leave us inspired to live life to the fullest just as she did,” they wrote.

Alley’s breakout role as Rebecca Howe on “Cheers,” which ran from 1987 to 1993, earned her an Emmy and a Golden Globe award. She went on to collect more nominations and awards for her performances in the sitcom “Veronica’s Closet,” the crime series “The Last Don” and the TV film “David’s Mother.”

“As iconic as she was on screen, she was an even more amazing mother and grandmother,” her children with ex-husband Parker Stevenson wrote in their announcement Monday.
