“We’re obviously disappointed. You know, Herschel ran a strong race, he’s a great candidate, he’s a really good man. But Warnock is very formidable,” Faith and Freedom Coalition chair Ralph Reed, a top Walker ally, told The Washington Post. “This is a very competitive state and we just came up a little bit short today.”

“We got a big Election Day vote that we thought we would get, we hoped we would get, but the margin in the outlying counties wasn’t big enough, and his margin in the big counties — DeKalb, Fulton, Gwinnett, Cobb — was. That’s pretty much the story,” Reed added. “It’s the difference between an incumbent governor running against a challenger, and a challenger running against an incumbent senator. It was always going to be a very hard-fought race, a very tough race. But Herschel stayed in there. He was resilient. We got stronger, and he’s a gamer, he ran a great race.”
