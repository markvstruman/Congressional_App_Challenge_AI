Today, Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) praised Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (Ariz.) as a “good and effective senator” and suggested that her switch to an independent will not have much impact on the powers of the Democratic majority in the new Congress. In a video released earlier Friday, Sinema said the change is “a reflection of who I’ve always been.” Schumer said Sinema would continue to serve on her current committees and that he is “looking forward to a productive session in the new Democratic majority Senate.”
