Billionaire Twitter CEO Elon Musk on Sunday used his social media company in a crass attack targeting a lawmaker who had criticized his assault on free speech.

Musk slammed the size of Rep. Adam Schiff’s (D-Calif.) “brain” in a tweet.

“Thankfully, you lose your chairmanship very soon,” Musk wrote Sunday, referring to Schiff’s position heading the House Intelligence Committee. “Your brain is too small.”

Schiff will step down as the committee chair as a Republican majority takes over the House.

Musk’s tweet — taken down later in the day — was in response to Schiff’s tweet Friday criticizing Musk’s Twitter policies censoring journalists whose coverage he doesn’t like, while allowing the return of Twitter users banned for spreading hate and disinformation.

Musk, for example, has allowed the Twitter restoration of notorious neo-Nazi Andrew Anglin, a racist, antisemite, homophobe and misogynist who declared in 2018 that women “deserve to be beaten, raped and locked in cages.”

Musk calls himself a “free speech absolutist to justify turning a blind eye to hatred and bigotry on Twitter,” Schiff wrote.

Schiff and Rep. Mark Takano (D-Calif.) earlier this month sent a letter to Musk inquiring about his content moderation strategy in light of research showing that hate speech has spiked on Twitter since Musk took over in October.
