Liz Truss has resigned as the United Kingdom's prime minister six weeks after being elected leader of the Conservative Party.

It makes her the UK's shortest-serving leader ever, with another Conservative leadership election due to take place within a week.

Truss followed Margaret Thatcher and Theresa May as Britain's third female premier. She succeeded Boris Johnson, who resigned in July after a series of scandals.

Weeks into her premiership, Truss was already under fire for a controversial mini-budget full of unfunded tax-cutting measures that sent financial markets into meltdown. At one point, the pound sank to its lowest level against the dollar in decades.

Here are some of the stories that made headlines over the past week, as well as some photos that caught our eye.
