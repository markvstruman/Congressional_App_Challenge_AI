So far, Democratic leaders are straining to avoid answering that hypothetical. The Arizona Democratic Party has excoriated Sinema for the move, but the national party is taking a very different tack, clearly hoping to keep its powder dry until it has to make a choice.

If history is any guide, the answer is: They’ll back whoever is mostly likely to win. But while this current situation bears similarities to others from recent years, it carries with it some dynamics we simply haven’t seen.

There are two other independents who caucus with Democrats: Maine’s Angus King and Vermont’s Bernie Sanders. Both are more reliable votes for the blue side, and largely because of that, neither has run into a Democratic opponent like Sinema might. ...

Sinema is one of the two most unpopular members of the Democratic caucus in Washington. ... And given the distaste for her from the activist and donor classes — combined with increasing intolerance, from each party’s base, of alleged apostates — it might be very difficult for national Democrats to back her or even just sit the contest out. And that goes double given that Arizona is a swing state ...

The real problems creep in if it looks like Sinema has a better shot than the Democratic nominee, be it Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.) or someone else. At that point, the party will surely want to back the most likely winner, as it almost always does — and especially in a year in which the party is expected to play extensive defense while defending its narrow 51-49 majority. But selling that decision to a base that feels like a West Virginia Democrat should be a loyal party line vote would be another matter entirely.
