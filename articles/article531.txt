“We ended up having a candidate quality” challenge, McConnell said, pointing out that he’d been warning about this in advance. “Look at Arizona. Look at New Hampshire, and the challenging situation in Georgia, as well.”

He added: “We had an opportunity to relearn, one more time you have to have quality candidates to win competitive Senate races.” The cause of the low-quality candidates? McConnell wasn’t subtle: “the support of the former president” — that is, Donald Trump — “proved to be very decisive in these primaries,” and candidates like those in the states he mentioned were the result.
