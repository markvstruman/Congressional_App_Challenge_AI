# How the heritability of politics works?

by Tyler Cowen June 3, 2022 at 12:44 pm  in

  * Political Science

> Estimates from the Minnesota Twin Study show that sociopolitical
> conservatism is extraordinarily heritable (74%) for the most informed fifth
> of the public – much more so than population-level results (57%) – but with
> much lower heritability (29%) for the public’s bottom half.

Here is the research article by Nathan P. Kalmoe and Martin Johnson. The
reference is from Matt Yglesias, and one possibility is that you are born with
inherited values, but you need to be educated to learn where those values
ought to put you on the political spectrum.
