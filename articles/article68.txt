Montana is holding congressional primaries on Tuesday. Polls closed at 8 p.m. local time and 10 p.m. ET.

The races and the stakes:

Montana gained one new seat in the House of Representatives after the 2020 Census, doubling the state's representation in the House, and shifting the political landscape of the state in the process.

The state's 1st Congressional District, located in the western region of Montana, is open and has no incumbent in the race.

The GOP field in Montana's 1st District includes five candidates: Mitch Heuer, Matt Jette, former state Sen. Albert Olszewski, pastor Mary Todd, and Ryan Zinke, the former US representative, Navy SEAL, and former interior secretary under President Donald Trump.

While some of his opponents are trying to label Zinke as too "Liberal," he received an endorsement from Trump in July 2021, whom Zinke recently referred to as a "kingmaker." Zinke stepped down from his role with the Trump administration in December 2018 amid a series of ethics probes into questionable expenditures.

There are three candidates on the Democratic side: Cora Neumann, former state Sen. Tom Winter, and lawyer Monica Tranel.

Four Republicans will be facing off in the eastern 2nd Congressional District: Charles A. Walking Child, Kyle Austin, James Boyette, and Rep. Matt Rosendale, the current representative for Montana's at-large Congressional district. Rosendale also received an endorsement from Trump in July 2021.

On the Democratic side, there will be three candidates on the ballot — only two, however, are living: Penny Ronning and Skylar Williams. Former state Rep. Mark Sweeney will also be included on the ballot, though he unexpectedly died in early May.

Republicans are predicted to do well in the general elections come November — according to Sabato's Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia's Center for Politics, the 1st Congressional District is rated as "Likely R" and the 2nd Congressional District as "Safe R."
