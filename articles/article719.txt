Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson (R) didn’t hold back on why he believes former President Donald Trump isn’t a “ticket to victory” for Republicans during a CNN interview on Wednesday.

Hutchinson told CNN anchor Erin Burnett that he believes there’s a “diminishing” number of fellow lawmakers in his party who believe a Trump endorsement would lead them to an election win. (You can watch the video below).

“There’s a cost that comes with his endorsement, we saw this time and time again in the midterm elections,” Hutchinson said. “And whenever candidates talk about common sense conservative values and address the challenges of inflation and energy costs, they win on the Republican side because the voters trust Republican principles and ideas.”

Hutchinson added, “They just don’t want to get trapped into the past and the debate over the last election and conspiracy theories...”
