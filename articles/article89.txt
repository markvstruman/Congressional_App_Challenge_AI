The House committee investigating the Capitol attack that left five dead and more than 140 officers injured voted unanimously earlier this month to subpoena Trump to testify under oath about his involvement in the attack and his attempt to stop the certification process for President Joe Biden. Trump responded to the news by issuing a 14-page letter that ranted about a “Rigged and Stolen” election.

Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), the committee’s vice chair, said she wouldn’t accept live television testimony from Trump.
